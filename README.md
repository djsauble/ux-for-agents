## Design Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains all design-related documentation that agents should reference when making changes to the codebase. This includes:

- Design system specifications
- Component guidelines
- Color schemes and typography
- Layout patterns
- Interaction patterns
- Accessibility requirements

## Development Guidelines

1. Always reference the design documentation in `docs/` before making changes
2. Keep code and documentation in sync
3. Follow the established component structure
4. Maintain consistent naming conventions
5. Document any deviations from the design system
